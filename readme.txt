15112 FINAL PROJECT by jcheng3

Title of Project: 3D Game Of Life
Description:
Inspired by Conway's original Game Of Life, a 2D cellular automaton, this
project will be a 3D rendition of this classic. Powered by Panda3D, the player
will, in a 3D seeding stage, seed certain cells in space. Then, by changing
settings that determine iteration speed, size of grid, and duration of
simulation, the 3D Game Of Life will play out. Additional features that will be
added (if there is time left) will be a multiplayer function, and/or options to
render Game Of Life on grids mapped onto different 3D surfaces (such as on
cubes, spheres, pyramids, taurus, etc).

HOW TO RUN:
The Game can be launched by running the file labeled: GOL_main3.py
Depending on your installed version of python, this can sometimes be done by double-clicking the file itself to run.
However, if you are encountering errors, I would suggest using your command line and run the file with Panda3D's specific version of python.
The necessary version of python can be found in the Panda3D Folder labeled Panda3D-1.9.4-x64.
The version of python should be contained in the subfolder labeled python.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This project uses Panda3D, which requires a very specific version of Python to run.
Read the following on instructions to correctly install Panda3D

PANDA3D Installation:
Visit https://jli8554.gitbooks.io/panda-3d/ for install instructions for all systems.
Contained in the submission folder is the two texture files that are used in the game, labeled fire.png and waterTexture.png
Once you have correctly installed Panda3D, move these .png files into the texture subfolder in your Panda3D-1.9.4-x64.

The path for this would be Panda3D-1.9.4-x64/models/textures
If this folder does not exist, create the textures folder and label it textures

This is the 15112 manual for Panda3D, which includes installation instructions. 

Thank You, and Have Fun!
